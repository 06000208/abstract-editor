# abstract-editor

An offline [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) for editing abstract data.

The goal is to provide an intuitive graphical interface for visually editing data of any nature, primarily data stored via [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), while retaining the ability to edit the raw text and providing features such as search, tags, edit history, and so on.

Whether it can achieve that is another matter, and presently, it's in a highly experimental initial development.

By "data of any nature", I mean data like...

- Text with headers, document-esque
- Icons and website links (such as with bookmarks)
- A folder's worth of images
- Monthly transatlantic airtravel data
- Family photos
- A long JSON array of different communities with corresponding website urls, descriptions, and branding images
- A list of video games with accompanying links to their digital distribution websites
- Articles about specific topics
- Notes and todo lists
- Bookmarks
- References and citations
- None of the above

Abstract editor intends to accomplish it's goal for whatever your purpose and data by implementing a wide range of different displays and components. Such as a basic page, a table, a gallery, a [tree view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_view), [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board), and so on. Even something suitable for [tier lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_list).

It draws inspiration from many things, mainly:

- [Knowledge bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base)
- [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)
- [Note-taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking) software
- [Browser bookmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmark_(digital))
- [Productivity software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_software)
- [Collaborative software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software)
- [Task management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management#Task_management_software)
- [Reference management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_management_software)
- [Password managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager)
- [Tag editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_editor)
