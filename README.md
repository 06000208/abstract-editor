# abstract-editor (extension branch)

A [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension adding an intuitive graphical interface and various features for working with abstract data.

By "abstract data", I'm referring to pretty much anything you might want to store via JSON, but would be too inconvenient to do manually.
